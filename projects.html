				  <b>European Youth Parliament</b> a.k.a. <b>EYP</b> is non-partisan and independent educational programme for young European citizens involving 40.000+ participants in its activities annually. What are we doing there? Discovering, meeting, inspiring, sharing, creating. This is a single greatest organization that, in only 2 years after my first EYP experience, has filled my life nearly fully: at this point, every single day I dedicate it at least two hours. Having tried almost every role in the organization, ranging from delegate to President, I have decided to develop EYP organizationally and was selected for a position of a Board Member on Human Recourses in EYP-Ukraine.<a href="http://eyp.org//">Learn more</a>

				  <b>CACTUS</b> is an international English language program aimed at promoting civic society development in the next generation of young leaders in Ukraine. Those amazing guys gather each summer in Ternopil for two weeks to teach the wonders of project management and community service to 100 future leaders in Ukraine. As a final part of the program, participants present their project ideas. They also get a chance to get funded by CACTUS and later, as little CACTUS splashes, projects born in Ternopil are happening all around Ukraine. A lot of fun is happening during the event itself, of course. In 2013 I happen to lead <a href="https://vk.com/cactus2014">the Media Team</a>  of the project that produced cool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGnV-QTGa0tK8J79k1gfJA/feed?view_as=public">overviews</a> of what CACTUS is about. <a href="http://cactusua.org/">Learn more</a>

				  <b> Peace Corps Volunteer Camps</b> are summer camps that used to be led by Peace Corps, American Volunteers that came to serve in Ukraine for 2,5 years. Having participated in 7+ of these events taking roles of camper, Junior Counselor, organizer, Teamleader and Chief of Staff over the past three years, I wholeheartedly believe that this is one of the most important projects developed for Ukrainian Youth. Each camp has itâ€™s own topic ranging from HIV and Human Trafficking prevention to Environmentalism. Here is a <a href="http://youtu.be/1V7LA8EAKdM?t=1m18s/">short glimpse</a> into what we do in the camps. <a href="www.pcukraine.org/">Learn more</a>
