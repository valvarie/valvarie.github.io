				  <i>I have learnt more in 10 days of <b>EYP</b> then in  15 years of school</i> - said one of the delegates I have chaired. It has happened that most of the competences I possess and predict to be using professionally come from <b>European Youth Parliament</b>. Not only have I acquired understanding of how European Union functions, deepen my appreciation for European values, reopened European identity in me and gained insight on contemporary problems of global society, I have learnt very basic skills. EYP has taught me to express my ideas in writing, compromise and communicate in multicultural environment. EYP has given me a chance to organize projects with 100+ participants, manage teams over short and long periods of time, coordinate projects. I believe I learnt to love people through EYP. You can learn more about the organization <a href=http://eyp.org//">here</a>.

				  <b>LCC</b> in an International University based in Klaipeda where currently I am enrolled in second year of B.A. in Contemporary Communications. I have also tried myself in B.S. in Psychology but that did not turn out very well :) This is a great place to start your higher education.<a href="www.lcc.lt/">Learn more</a>

				  <b>Erasmus+</b> is an educational program funded by European Commission. There are a lot of things that one may take from the program (including greatest Joint Master Programs across the world). I have taken part in a number of Erasmus+ trainings across Europe, these are great to develop some practical skills and get to know awesome internationals.
